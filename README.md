## Overview

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds are valuable for large-scale 3D scene understanding, but collecting dense and complete scans is expensive and operationally demanding. Point-cloud upsampling provides a practical way to reconstruct denser scenes from sparse observations.

Most existing upsampling benchmarks generate sparse inputs by synthetically decimating dense point clouds. However, this process does not fully reproduce the irregular sampling patterns, occlusions, and local density variations found in actual ALS acquisitions.

To address this limitation, we introduce:

* **YUPU**, a scene-level ALS point-cloud upsampling benchmark constructed from overlapping physical flight-line acquisitions.
* **GCDM**, a Geometry-Appearance Conditioned Diffusion Model that combines point coordinates, local surface geometry, and multi-view projection features for point-cloud reconstruction.
